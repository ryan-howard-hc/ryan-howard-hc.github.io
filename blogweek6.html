<h1>Week 6 - React Intro</h1>
<h2>Are javascript frameworks and libraries easy or hard to use?</h2>
<p>Well, learning them is already becoming a pain in the ass, but in a lot of respects I would say easier in the long run. It is certainly confusing right now to connect all of these individual js pages as well as switching to a new method of javascript immediately following any understand of javascript.</p>

<h2>What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?</h2>
<p>Seeing as how I've barely touched this so far, I feel like this would be a better question a week or two from now! But after a little further review, Next.js has been what we're working with, so that for now (haha). All jokes aside, Ive seen material-ui and I have interest in creating an app or two, or gaining at least rudimentary experience in this topic.</p>

<h2>One emerging JavaScript tool that Id like to learn more about</h2>
<p>In a world where much is life is based around efficiency and speed, I started reading about ESBuild. 
- Extreme speed without needing a cache
- JavaScript, CSS, TypeScript, and JSX built-in
- A straightforward API for CLI, JS, and Go
- Bundles ESM and CommonJS modules
- Tree shaking, minification, and source maps
- Local server, watch mode, and plugins</p>
