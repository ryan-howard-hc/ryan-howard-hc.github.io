<h1>Week 3! (Weak 3!)</h1>

<h1>Holding me back</h1>
<p>Javascript is ridiculously difficult for me to wrap my head around. Mostly it's difficult to sit down and interpret how to approach the actual problem. Solving the problem is less as difficult, but seeing the actual goalpost for me rather than kicking the ball in, has been the bane of my existence this week. The mindreader project had me struggling more than all the others combined thus far. Lets just hope it doesnt stay that way!</p>

<h1>JS, BOOTSTRAP, AND ATOMIC DESIGN</h1>
<p>Bootstrap and atomic design at least mesh with how my brain works to some degree. Javascript is going to feel like learning a new language. Like I said before, it's going to be difficult to even know the right questions to ask, but that's where to start I guess. Working with functions, properly labeling my variables, and tying them all together is going to take some practice.</p>

<h1>What's your 'Why'?</h1>
<p>I want to find something that meshes well with the lifestyle Id enjoy pursuing. I am always eager about learning, but not always eager to fall down and have to get up instead of just sleeping there (haha). The reaches of this profession are almost limitless in this day and age, and Id like to have the proper skills to chase any ambitions. Maybe this will lead into or open up the gates for a career in video game development? Who knows? Either way, im here!</p>
