## The Rebirthing 

The First week was not at all what I was expecting. _Pure_ anxiety, lack of preparedness, and a propensity for overlooking details is getting the best of me. Im learning to slow down and go at my own pace instead of trying to keep up with the more knowledgeable individuals in my cohort. Luckily, the people in the course attending with me have been very friendly, non-judgmental, and helpful. Im still coming out of my shell, and need to get out there and ask more questions.

## Expanding what I know
---
- First and foremost, get used to asking for help
- Before diving into material, read instructions thoroughly and determine what the end goal is
- Expand my usage of the terminal and properly utilize the 'git-flow strategy'
- Repeat repeat repeat my usage of HTML and CSS to familiarize my understanding of the product
- Lastly, not get too comfortable. As was stated previously, if ya aint uncomfortable, ya aint learnin'

## Who am i?

I wish I could even answer this, but I love puttering around in my 'garden.' Love my tropical plants, and messing around with shrimp and fishtanks!

# Week 2!

## HTML, CSS, AND JS
<br>

HTML was surprisingly straightforward and relatively simple. Cascading Style Sheets can definitely be a lot of fun to tinker with, but as im starting bootstrap, it seems secondary to that. Lastly, Javascript is a huge pain in the ass to learn, but Im hoping with time it will become secondhand.

<br>

I definitely see the value in pseudocode, but the truth is that it will not truly come in handy until I have a grasp on the structure and code itself! But it's basically laying out an outline before you make your rough draft, which dramatically reduces how long it takes to build a solid structure.
<br>

## Remotely onboarding
<br>

Having the freedom to take breaks when I need to, especially during the ridiculous insecurity and anxiety I had starting out, was crucial. So many new faces along with getting bombarded with new information that was a totally foreign concept. 
### Hindrances
The only hindrance was not having instructors within shouting distance if I need them now, but theyre pretty on point with their help if I message them. This speaks to the fact the boons of remote work is that they can answer whenever and not be limited to the 9-5 if they choose to.
### Overcoming challenges
Being able to find answers when I need to, refining my searches, and interpreting what the code means after has truly helped. Otherwise Id be sitting around, looking at foreign material, panicking, not getting anything done.. rinse,repeat as it snowballs. 

# Week 3! (Weak 3!)

## Holding me back
Javascript is ridiculously difficult for me to wrap my head around. Mostly it's difficult to sit down and interpret how to approach the actual problem. Solving the problem is less as difficult, but seeing the actual goalpost for me rather than kicking the ball in, has been the bane of my existence this week. The mindreader project had me struggling more than all the others combined thus far. Lets just hope it doesnt stay that way!

## JS, BOOTSTRAP, AND ATOMIC DESIGN
Bootstrap and atomic design at least mesh with how my brain works to some degree. Javascript is going to feel like learning a new language. Like I said before, it's going to be difficult to even know the right questions to ask, but that's where to start I guess. Working with functions, properly labeling my variables, and tying them all together is going to take some practice.

## What's your 'Why'?
I want to find something that meshes well with the lifestyle Id enjoy pursuing. I am always eager about learning, but not always eager to fall down and have to get up instead of just sleeping there (haha). The reaches of this profession are almost limitless in this day and age, and Id like to have the proper skills to chase any ambitions. Maybe this will lead into or open up the gates for a career in video game development? Who knows? Either way, im here!

# WEEK 4! Sprint 2

## What did I learn about the development process?
I learned quite a bit, I learned I need to slow down my learning process, and actually absorb what I am doing. In the same vain, learned take a nap if youre not processing the information. More specifically, I learned the importance of a kind of derivative thinking regarding most functions. I learned how to organize my code properly, having almost a 'key' for my variables. Im learning I need to stop extra time reading over materials on the weekends. NO REST!

## Developing good code / Becoming a good developer
The principal of thinking of the end user is the primary goal along continually learning. Making it readable, efficient, and easily maintained are probably the next largest factors. Also words from wiser devs: Good pseudo, good documentation, and good preparation for any potential future updates. I think these two questions are equally important and just facets of the other. Traits such as having patience, knowing when to take breaks when youre not able to think properly, as well as versing yourself in marketable and useful skills.

## What is the one thing programmers hate?
WET code (We enjoy typing). Sloppy code and convoluted code. Code that is overly difficult to interpret. Spoiler alert: there's more than one


# WEEK 5!

## What exactly is pseudocode?
Simply put, pseudocode is a rudimentary step of instructions which is intended to be read by people rather than machine reading. It's an easy way to draw out a basic idea or plan on how to tackle an issue or task in computer science. You take this rough draft of sorts to outline what your attack plan on building algorithms and the complementary structure surrounding it.
## The Advantages of the pseudo
Pseudocode is particularly useful for less experienced developers as it can use any language that the programmer prefers and understands or is proficient in. The more fleshed out the basic instructions are make getting to the end goal much less strenuous, as well as less likely to contain errors or missing features. For front-end it can allow an actual sketch of what you or the client want it to look like. It's also an easier concept to run by peers who might be able to offer insight with rough visuals and an attack plan. It's like building a puzzle in the sense that you can just grab larger pieces, put them together, and link them to the larger picture. Or like a trellis that allows you to lead your plant in the right direction.
