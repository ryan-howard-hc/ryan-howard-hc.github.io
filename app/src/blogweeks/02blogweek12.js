      <h2>Agile development? Benefits?</h2>

      <p>Agile Development is a way to make software that's more flexible and customer-focused. It's like building a puzzle one piece at a time, making sure each piece fits well. A piece of that, our Scrum, our daily stand-up. The Daily Stand-up is a quick daily meeting where the team talks about what they did yesterday, what they'll do today, and if anything is blocking them. It helps the team work together better. </p>
      <h2>Frameworks? Benefits?</h2>

      <p>Using a framework is like using a recipe when cooking. It helps you make food faster, tastes better, and is safer. Similarly, frameworks help make software faster, better, and more secure. Efficiency, It's like having pre-made ingredients that save you time when cooking. Consistency, It helps you follow a recipe correctly every time, just like coding standards in frameworks. Community Support, It's like having friends who can give you cooking tips. Framework communities help you when you're stuck. Security, It's like knowing how to handle food safely to avoid getting sick. Frameworks keep your software safe from problems. Scalability, It's like knowing how to make more servings of a dish. Frameworks help your software handle growth. Upgradability, It's like getting new and improved recipes. Framework updates make your software better. Market Demand, Imagine being a cook in demand because you know how to use popular kitchen tools. Using frameworks can make you a sought-after developer.</p>
