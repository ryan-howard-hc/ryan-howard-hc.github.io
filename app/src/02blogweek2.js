      <h1>HTML, CSS, AND JS</h1>
      <p>HTML was surprisingly straightforward and relatively simple. Cascading Style Sheets can definitely be a lot of fun to tinker with, but as I'm starting bootstrap, it seems secondary to that. Lastly, Javascript is a huge pain in the ass to learn, but I'm hoping with time it will become secondhand.</p>

      <h1>Pseu-pseu-pseucoding</h1>
      <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r0qBaBb1Y-U/hqdefault.jpg" alt="sususudio" />
      <p>I definitely see the value in pseudocode, but the truth is that it will not truly come in handy until I have a grasp on the structure and code itself! But it's basically laying out an outline before you make your rough draft, which dramatically reduces how long it takes to build a solid structure.</p>

      <h1>Remotely onboarding</h1>
      <p>Having the freedom to take breaks when I need to, especially during the ridiculous insecurity and anxiety I had starting out, was crucial. So many new faces along with getting bombarded with new information that was a totally foreign concept.</p>
      <h2>Hindrances</h2>
      <p>The only hindrance was not having instructors within shouting distance if I need them now, but they're pretty on point with their help if I message them. This speaks to the fact the boons of remote work is that they can answer whenever and not be limited to the 9-5 if they choose to.</p>
      <h2>Overcoming challenges</h2>
      <p>Being able to find answers when I need to, refining my searches, and interpreting what the code means after has truly helped. Otherwise, I'd be sitting around, looking at foreign material, panicking, not getting anything done.. rinse, repeat as it snowballs.</p>
