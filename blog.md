## The Rebirthing 

The First week was not at all what I was expecting. _Pure_ anxiety, lack of preparedness, and a propensity for overlooking details is getting the best of me. Im learning to slow down and go at my own pace instead of trying to keep up with the more knowledgeable individuals in my cohort. Luckily, the people in the course attending with me have been very friendly, non-judgmental, and helpful. Im still coming out of my shell, and need to get out there and ask more questions.

## Expanding what I know
---
- First and foremost, get used to asking for help
- Before diving into material, read instructions thoroughly and determine what the end goal is
- Expand my usage of the terminal and properly utilize the 'git-flow strategy'
- Repeat repeat repeat my usage of HTML and CSS to familiarize my understanding of the product
- Lastly, not get too comfortable. As was stated previously, if ya aint uncomfortable, ya aint learnin'
 

## Who am i?

I wish I could even answer this, but I love puttering around in my 'garden.' Love my tropical plants, and messing around with shrimp and fishtanks!

# Week 2!

## HTML, CSS, AND JS
<br>

HTML was surprisingly straightforward and relatively simple. Cascading Style Sheets can definitely be a lot of fun to tinker with, but as im starting bootstrap, it seems secondary to that. Lastly, Javascript is a huge pain in the ass to learn, but Im hoping with time it will become secondhand.

## Pseu-pseu-pseucoding

<br>

I definitely see the value in pseudocode, but the truth is that it will not truly come in handy until I have a grasp on the structure and code itself! But it's basically laying out an outline before you make your rough draft, which dramatically reduces how long it takes to build a solid structure.

## Remotely onboarding
<br>

Having the freedom to take breaks when I need to, especially during the ridiculous insecurity and anxiety I had starting out, was crucial. So many new faces along with getting bombarded with new information that was a totally foreign concept. 
### Hindrances
The only hindrance was not having instructors within shouting distance if I need them now, but theyre pretty on point with their help if I message them. This speaks to the fact the boons of remote work is that they can answer whenever and not be limited to the 9-5 if they choose to.
### Overcoming challenges
Being able to find answers when I need to, refining my searches, and interpreting what the code means after has truly helped. Otherwise Id be sitting around, looking at foreign material, panicking, not getting anything done.. rinse,repeat as it snowballs.
