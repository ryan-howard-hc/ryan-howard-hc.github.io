<h1>Week 8 || HALFWAY!!!</h1>
<h2>Biggest Hurdle of the Bootcamp? Next Mountain to Climb?</h2>
<p>Without doubt, the biggest hurdle has been my own mind. Im very proficient in Front End programming. Id wager im doing much better than I think I am, though Im constantly having doubts and dealing with my self worth. Also, as a terrible test taker, whiteboard interviews have been daunting to say the least. Even being well versed in a subject, there is something about your boss or professor watching as you try to solve a problem on the spot. One of those moments where all of a sudden, you know nothing. As far as the subject matter, the biggest hurdle would have been learning Javascript. In some ways, it seems like reading backwards. Ive always been pretty solid with puzzle solving and math equations, but some problems seem overly complicated or unnecessarily convoluted. Some of the syntax seems like it was first created by a person with no understanding of the english language.</p>

<h2>Three Ideas for a Final Project?</h2>
<p>I intend to do at least a couple projects. Id love to go above and beyond what is asked as Im determined to make it into this field. Id like to make a functioning website for my uncle's floral design business. Im also interested in creating an app for plant maintenance and information for houseplants as that is my longest lasting passion at this point in my life. While not web development, Im also interested in creating an indie game based on one of my favorite turn based strategies. Lastly, I feel encouraged to create a strong, economically viable site for business application. It seems like a confident choice in a world where money talks, all jokes aside. Id like to create monetary value, as Id love to expand my portfolio to show I will work towards whatever is needed! They are about the same as before, though the indie game seems more within grasp the more versed and confident I become with my programming abilities. Id love to learn C# as suggested by Justin Hall!</p>
<h2>What surprised me about Python?</h2>
<p>After learning JS, I was surprised that Python's syntax seems more fluid, or more accurately, less of a nightmare to the english language. Im still knee deep in the learning process, and there is still time to hate Python! All jokes aside, I have a feeling it's going to be more user-friendly.</p>
