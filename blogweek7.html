    <h1>Week 7 - CLI</h1>
        <img src="/portfolio/img/2023-07-10 15_18_51-When you hack into the mainframe and disable their algorithms _ antimeme.png">
        <h2>What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?</h2>
        <p>At first glance, yes, CLI's are scary. After learning rudimentary coding experience, it's more of an experiential problem. What are they useful for? They allow for relatively easy for navigating through file systems through basic commands. They also provide built in systems that provide commands for this navigation and for commands to control the system. Another very important use for CLI's are that they allow scripting and automating repetitive tasks involved in command executions. Lastly, they allow for remote access/networking. They can be used to establish secure connections remotely and checking connectivity.</p>
        <h2>If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?</h2>
        <p>It could allow for importing, exporting files for backup or automated reading purposes. It could provide integration between an OS and programs or communication between other programs. It could allow for automated updating tasks or prioritizing tasks. Also could allow for customization in this same respect.</p>
        <h2>List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code</h2>
        <p>After conversing with other bootcampers, it could allow for developing our own APIs, which I am interested in learning more about. I cant imagine how difficult itd be for integration tests like for example on my github. It'd be almost essential for making authentication on the user end reasonable within the context of billable hours. </p>
